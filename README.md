# snapchat-username

> A python script to check if snapchat usernames are available or not.

I have moved this repository from my other github profile. A simple and easy Python script to read/use, that uses the Requests & PySimpleGUI libraries.
It has a basic GUI, it works and i don't intend to update this script any further. If the script "doesn't work", just change the web header.

## Install

```
# Download the repo
https://github.com/AmirAliuA/snapchat-username.git
# Run the python script
python3 usernames.py
```

## Requirements
> Python 3
> Requests
> PySimpleGUI

## Contribute

If you think this could be better, contribute to this repo or fork your own, just credit me.
