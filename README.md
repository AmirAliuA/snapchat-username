# Snapchat Username Checker
A Python script to check the availability of Snapchat usernames.

This is a simple Python script with a basic GUI built using the `Requests` and `PySimpleGUI` libraries. 
I originally hosted this repository on a different GitHub profile but decided to move it here. 

The script is straightforward to use, and it works as intended. However, I don't plan to update it further. If it stops working, you might need to update the web headers in the script.

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmirAliuA/snapchat-username.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd snapchat-username

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the script
```bash
python3 usernames.py
```
