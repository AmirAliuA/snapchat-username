> A python script to check if snapchat usernames are available or not.

This repository is meant to serve as a general template for how to set up new repositories in the @orbitdb organization. In general, setting up a new repository should take only a few minutes; use this repository as a way of finding example files, and use the following checklist to ensure that you've set up the repository correctly.

I have moved this repository from my other github profile. A simple and easy Python script to read/use, that uses the Requests & PySimpleGUI libraries.
It has a basic GUI, it works and i don't intend to update this script any further. If the script "doesn't work", just change the web header.

## Install

You need Python 3.

```
# Download the repo
https://github.com/AmirAliuA/snapchat-username.git
# Run the python script
python3 usernames.py
```
